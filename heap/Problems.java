	 *  In an emergency room, patients arrive with various medical conditions, 
	 *  and they need to be prioritized for treatment. Implement a program that sorts the 
	 *  patients based on the severity of their conditions (highest to lowest) using Heap Sort.

	 *	Imagine a scenario where passengers are checking in at an airport. 
	 *  Each passenger has a priority based on their ticket class. Business class passengers have the 
	 *  highest priority, followed by first class, and then economy class. 
	 *  Write a program that sorts the passengers into a queue based on their priority using Heap Sort.

	 *	A customer support system receives tickets from users. Sort the tickets bo using Heap Sort 
	 *  on their priority, with high-priority tickets at the top,

	 *	Users of a social media platform want to see posts from their friends sorted by the number of likes received. Implement Heap Sort to sort the posts in descending order of likes.
